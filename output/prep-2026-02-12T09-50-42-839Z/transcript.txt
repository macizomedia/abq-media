Amazon is not cutting 30,000 jobs because they have too many managers, whatever they may say. They're cutting 30,000 jobs because they need the money to buy GPUs. That's the story nobody wants to tell you. Not Andy Jassy on the earnings call, not the business press dutifully repeating the culture narrative, not the analysts who'd rather talk about AWS growth rates and the brutal arithmetic reshaping big tech from the inside out. So here's what really happened. Amazon's quarterly free cash flow went negative. Negative $4.8 billion to be exact, at the exact moment their capital expenditure hit $125 billion, the highest of any company on Earth, with 75% of it going directly to AI infrastructure. They raised $12 billion in debt this year to fund data centers. And then they eliminated 10% of their white-collar workforce. That's the 30,000 jobs. This is not a layoff. This is a capital reallocation. Human headcount is being converted to compute capacity. Salaries are being transformed into silicon. And if you understand why Amazon is making this trade, you understand something very important about what's coming for the entire tech industry. Because the numbers just don't add up. Let's start with the contradiction that should make you suspicious of every official explanation you've heard. Amazon just posted one of its strongest quarters in years. Revenue hit $180 billion, up 13% year over year. AWS is growing at 20%, the fastest clip since 2022. Net income surged 38%. The stock jumped 10% after earnings. And by every conventional measure, this company is firing on all cylinders. And then they fired the 30,000 people. Not warehouse workers, not seasonal fulfillment staff, corporate employees, engineers, product managers, the people who build things. And what will become the largest layoff in Amazon's 30-year history, the company is eliminating roughly 10% of the white-collar workforce. 14,000 in October, another 16,000 this week. And that was planned together. CEO Andy Jassy wants you to believe this is about culture. The announcement was not really driven financially, he said. And it's not even AI-driven, he said. Instead, he said it was about culture. Too many layers, too much bureaucracy. Amazon, he continues to beat this drum, needs to operate like the world's largest startup. That is a compelling narrative. It's also carefully constructed to obscure what the balance sheet makes obvious. Amazon's free cash flow tells a story that Andy Jassy, I think, would rather not discuss on earnings calls. In 2024, Amazon generated $38 billion in free cash flow. That sounds healthy until you understand what happened next. As of Q3 2025, quarterly free cash flow went negative. The trailing 12-month figure dropped 61% year over year. Free cash flow margin collapsed from 8.73% of sales to just 2.7%. What changed? CapEx. Capital expenditure exploded. Amazon spent $83 billion on CapEx in 2024. In 2025, that number jumped to $125 billion, a 61% increase. CFO Brian Olsofski has already told investors to expect even higher spending in 2026. Amazon isn't stopping. Roughly 75% of all of this money is going directly to AI infrastructure, GPUs, custom Trainium chips, data centers, and the power systems that run them. To put these numbers in perspective, Amazon is now spending more on infrastructure in a single year, one year, than the entire gross domestic product of the country of Morocco. They're adding 3.8 gigawatts of data center capacity annually, enough to power 3 million homes every single year. They're on track to double their entire computing power by 2027. This is not a company with excess cash lying around. This is a company that went to the debt markets and raised $12 billion in bonds specifically to fund infrastructure investments. And oh, by the way, it's not a zero interest rate environment anymore. So even if it's Amazon and it's a blue chip bond, it's not free. When Bank of America's credit strategists analyzed hyperscaler spending, they found that aggregate CapEx among the big five, that is Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Oracle, now consumes, wait for it, 94% of operating cash flows after dividends and buybacks. That's approaching the theoretical maximum a company can spend without taking on really significant leverage. So what does this really mean? Amazon isn't cutting people because the culture is broken. Amazon is cutting people because they need the money. Look, let's do the math that Amazon's PR team hopes that you and I wouldn't do. 30,000 corporate employees eliminated. So what does that actually save us? Amazon's median total comp for corporate roles runs around $217,000 per year. That includes base salary, stock grants, and benefits. Assume the layoff pool skews a little bit below the median. Make the math. Call it $200,000 per head. All in. 30,000 employees times $200,000 equals roughly $6 billion in annual savings. Now, $6 billion sounds like a rounding error against $125 billion in capital expenditure, but that is the wrong comparison. The relevant comparison is free cash flow, the actual money available to fund investments after you've paid for everything else. When your quarterly FCF is negative $4.8 billion, well, an extra $6 billion a year actually matters a lot. That $6 billion is roughly what Amazon spent building Project Rainier, its massive AI computing platform packed with half a million custom Trainium 2 chips. It's enough to fund half of their annual investment in new data center campuses. It's the difference between issuing more debt and funding expansion internally. The pragmatic engineer argued against this thesis when the first wave of layoffs hit in October. And his analysis pointed to Amazon's $93 billion in cash reserves and $32 billion in trailing free cash flow, concluding that the layoffs won't make a big difference to how much it can invest in data centers. I would argue that analysis used backward-looking metrics. The cash flow picture had already deteriorated even more. Quarterly FCF was negative. CapEx guidance had increased by $7 billion. And Amazon had just raised another $12 billion in debt, something they wouldn't have had to do if they were swimming in excess cash. The numbers don't lie. Amazon is under financial pressure, not because the business is weak, but because the AI infrastructure race demands capital at a scale that even Amazon's profit engine struggles to generate. So what do we make of the culture narrative that Jassy gave? Understanding why Jassy frames this as a culture problem rather than a financial reallocation reveals something really important about how CEOs communicate during times of technological transformation. There are three audiences that Jassy has to satisfy, and each one needs to hear, frankly, a different version of reality. For employees, we're cutting you to buy more GPUs is a really brutal message. It implies your work doesn't matter, that you're simply a line item to be optimized away. The culture framing is a lot more gentle. It suggests that the cuts are about organizational effectiveness and not your individual value. You weren't eliminated because you cost too much. You were eliminated because there were too many layers between you and the customer. And to be fair to Andy Jassy, having worked at Amazon into the 2020s, he's not wrong. There are a lot of layers. It is possible that the culture narrative is true at the same time as the hard numbers forced his hand. For investors, admitting financial pressure is dangerous. Amazon trades at a premium because the market believes AWS and AI will generate massive returns. If Jassy said, we're cash constrained and need to cut headcount to fund infrastructure, the stock would be in trouble. The culture narrative lets him position the cuts as proactive optimization rather than reactive cost cutting. For regulators in the public, the AI replacement story creates problems. If Amazon admits these layoffs are about freeing capital to build AI systems, they invite a lot of scrutiny, perhaps congressional hearings, perhaps labor activism, bad headlines. It's better to frame it as routine corporate restructuring. And I think that's part of why Jassy chose to call out explicitly that these layoffs were not about AI as a productivity tool. The tell in all of this is in Jassy's own contradictions. In June of 2025, just four months before that first round of the 30,000 were laid off, he sent a memo to employees explicitly warning that AI would mean Amazon needs, quote, fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today. That memo is still on Amazon's public blog. But by the October earnings call, the message had shifted. Not AI-driven, not right now, at least. The hedge in that sentence, not right now, at least, reveals the tension. Jassy knows AI is part of this story. He just can't say it out loud when the analysts are listening. And again, to be fair to Jassy, the culture story isn't fabricated. It's just not the whole truth. Amazon did overhire during the pandemic. Between 2017 and 2022, the company's corporate headcount tripled. I was there during a lot of that time. When you grow that fast, you inevitably add layers. Middle managers accumulate. Decision making slows down. I saw that happen. The ownership culture that defined Amazon's early years gets diluted across too many people, too many meetings, and too many documents. Jassy has been talking about this problem for over a year. And in September of 2024, he mandated a return to five days in the office as part of his goal to reintroduce startup discipline to Amazon. Every major organization, he said, had to increase its ratio of individual contributors versus managers by at least 15%. And he created a no-bureaucracy email alias where employees could flag unnecessary processes. And that initiative, as much
