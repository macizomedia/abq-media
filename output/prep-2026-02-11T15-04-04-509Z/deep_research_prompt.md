## Main Talking Points Extracted
1. That's right, a markdown file, not a product, not a platform, a markdown file from some product manager at Anthropic erased $285 billion in market cap on the stock market in just 48 hours.
2. The per-seat SaaS licensing model, the financial bedrock that the entire enterprise software economy has been built on for 20 years, it was already cracking.
3. The software industry's average forward price-to-earnings ratio has been compressing for months, from 8 months ago to about 6 right when the sell-off hit.
4. And we should be precise about what actually happened because the narrative has already crystallized into Anthropic crashed the software market.
5. If a text file can approximate the core workflow of a $60 billion revenue legal information industry, then that whole pricing model that the industry is built on has a big structural problem.
6. The entire enterprise software economy, from Salesforce to ServiceNow to Adobe, runs on a model that says every human who touches this tool must pay a license fee.
7. Software's content, like proprietary databases, like structured workflows, decades of accumulated enterprise data, that hasn't been commoditized, and it actually probably won't be.
8. The KPMG negotiation is an operating event, a real company using AI as a lever in a real business negotiation to extract a real price reduction from a real counterparty.

## Transcript Excerpt
A 200-line prompt just killed $285 billion in market value. That's right, a markdown file, not a product, not a platform, a markdown file from some product manager at Anthropic erased $285 billion in market cap on the stock market in just 48 hours. On January 30th, Anthropic released a set of plugins for Claude Co-Work, its desktop AI tool. One of them handles legal contract review. It can triage NDAs. It can flag non-standard clauses against a negotiation playbook and generate a ton of compliance summaries, the kind of work that until last week required a paralegal, maybe a Westlaw subscription, something that had to do with billable hours, right? The plugin is open source. Anyone can read it. And when people did, they found roughly 200 lines of structured markdown prompts. First year law school content dressed up with some clever workflow logic. It's basically a fancy prompt. It shipped with a little disclaimer. All outputs should be reviewed by licensed attorneys. I'll bet. By Monday morning, Thompson Reuters had posted its biggest single day stock decline on record. It's down 16%. RELX, the parent company of LexisNexis, fell 14%. LegalZoom cratered at 20%. You get the idea. The selling spread to private equity from there. Aries Management, KKR, and TPG all dropped about 10%. If AI compresses the cost of legal and financial analysis, then every firm charging premium fees for that analysis has a big, big margin problem because they can't charge that much, not next year and maybe not now. But here's what almost nobody is saying clearly enough. The markdown file itself is not the cause. It just revealed what has been going on for a while. The per-seat SaaS licensing model, the financial bedrock that the entire enterprise software economy has been built on for 20 years, it was already cracking. The market just hadn't priced it in yet because frankly, Wall Street doesn't understand AI that well. So this crash wasn't really about Claude. And we should be precise about what actually happened because the narrative has already crystallized into Anthropic crashed the software market. And that framing, while it's fun for headlines, misses the real structural story. What
