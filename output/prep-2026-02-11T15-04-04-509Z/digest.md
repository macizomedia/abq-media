- That's right, a markdown file, not a product, not a platform, a markdown file from some product manager at Anthropic erased $285 billion in market cap on the stock market in just 48 hours.
- The per-seat SaaS licensing model, the financial bedrock that the entire enterprise software economy has been built on for 20 years, it was already cracking.
- The software industry's average forward price-to-earnings ratio has been compressing for months, from 8 months ago to about 6 right when the sell-off hit.
- And we should be precise about what actually happened because the narrative has already crystallized into Anthropic crashed the software market.
- If a text file can approximate the core workflow of a $60 billion revenue legal information industry, then that whole pricing model that the industry is built on has a big structural problem.
- The entire enterprise software economy, from Salesforce to ServiceNow to Adobe, runs on a model that says every human who touches this tool must pay a license fee.
- Software's content, like proprietary databases, like structured workflows, decades of accumulated enterprise data, that hasn't been commoditized, and it actually probably won't be.
- The KPMG negotiation is an operating event, a real company using AI as a lever in a real business negotiation to extract a real price reduction from a real counterparty.
