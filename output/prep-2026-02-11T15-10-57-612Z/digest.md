# Main Talking Points

- Current
projections I'm just it's not that
unusual to think that a average worker
consumption model will hit 10 billion
tokens annually within the next year and
a half on average right and you may be
over a 100red billion tokens very easily
with top users.
- And I do wonder if one
of the ways forward here is that the
workstations we're going to be using at
the enterprise will remain pretty dumb,
but we will buy that scarce cloud
capacity, which is exactly what the
hyperscalers would want because cloud
providers will offer substantial
discounts for committed user agreements.
- You need to plan for refresh cycles that
coincide with hardware generations
because every 18 to 24 months there's
going to be a new GPU architecture that
arrives with a really significant
capability improvement you're going to
want.
- Those that don't
are going to find themselves capacity
constrained and cost pressured and
they're going to be falling behind in
the biggest technology race in history.
- At 10
billion tokens per worker, the same
organization is now going to consume a
100red trillion tokens a year.
- Because supply
cannot respond to demand and demand
cannot be deferred, prices are going to
spike.
- Microsoft, Google, Amazon,
Meta, and Oracle have collectively
committed to hundreds of billions in
Nvidia purchases over the next several
years because of the demand I've been
talking about.
- They're going to underinvest in
flexibility and optionality and they're
going to assume supply availability that
isn't really there.
