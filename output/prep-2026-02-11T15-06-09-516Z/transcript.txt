A 200-line prompt just killed $285 billion in market value. That's right, a markdown file. Not a product, not a platform. A markdown file from some product manager at Anthropic erased $285 billion in market cap on the stock market in just 48 hours. On January 30th, Anthropic released a set of plugins for Claude CoWork, its desktop AI tool. One of them handles legal contract review. It can triage NDAs. It can flag non-standard clauses against a negotiation playbook and generate a ton of compliance summaries, the kind of work that until last week required a paralegal. Maybe a Westlaw subscription, something that had to do with billable hours, right? The plugin is open source. Anyone can read it. And when people did, they found roughly 200 lines of structured markdown prompts. First-year law school content dressed up with some clever workflow logic. It's basically a fancy prompt. It shipped with a little disclaimer. All output should be reviewed by licensed attorneys. I'll bet by Monday morning, Thompson Reuters had posted its biggest single-day stock decline on record. It's down 16%. RELX, the parent company of LexisNexis, fell 14%. LegalZoom cratered at 20%. You get the idea. The selling spread to private equity from there. Aries Management, KKR, and TPG all dropped about 10%. If AI compresses the cost of legal and financial analysis, then every firm charging premium fees for that analysis has a big, big margin problem because they can't charge that much. Not next year, and maybe not now. But here's what almost nobody is saying clearly enough. The markdown file itself is not the cause. It just revealed what has been going on for a while. The per-seat SaaS licensing model, the financial bedrock that the entire enterprise software economy has been built on for 20 years, it was already cracking. The market just hadn't priced it in yet because, frankly, Wall Street doesn't understand AI that well. So this crash wasn't really about Claude. And we should be precise about what actually happened because the narrative has already crystallized into Anthropic crashed the software market. And that framing, while it's fun for headlines, misses the real structural story. What Anthropic actually shipped was a set of open-source starter plugins, basically templates that any company can customize for their own workflows very easily. The legal plugin was one of 11. It was very competent, but it's not by itself revolutionary. Any decent prompt engineer could have assembled something comparable in an afternoon. So why did it move $285 billion? Because the plugin made visible what the market has been quietly worrying about for months. If a text file can approximate the core workflow of a $60 billion revenue legal information industry, then that whole pricing model that the industry is built on has a big structural problem. Not a competitive problem, not a better product problem, a structural problem. The kind that doesn't get solved by shipping faster or hiring better salespeople. Thomson Reuters charges per seat. LexisNexis charges per seat. Westlaw charges per seat. The entire enterprise software economy, from Salesforce to ServiceNow to Adobe, runs on a model that says every human who touches this tool must pay a license fee. That's how these companies make their money. That's how they forecast their revenue. That's how Wall Street values them. That model works when humans are the bottleneck. It breaks when AI agents can do the work without logging in. And the signals were already everywhere if you knew where to look. The software industry's average forward price-to-earnings ratio has been compressing for months, from 6x eight months ago to about 6x right when the sell-off hit. That is the largest four-month valuation compression since the 2002.com bust. Earnings season has already been ugly. Software companies are missing revenue estimates at rates not seen since the post-COVID correction. And broader tech continues to be the AI companies are fine, right? The per-seat model was under pressure before Anthropic shipped this little prompt file. So the cloud plugin, it didn't start the fire. It just showed everyone the building was already burning. Now, I gotta be honest. Plenty of smart people think that this sell-off is a big overreaction. And they might be right about the sell-off, but they would be wrong about what it means. Jensen Huang, speaking at the Cisco AI Summit a few days before the crash, offered the strongest version of the counter-argument. This notion that the software industry is in decline and being replaced by AI is the most illogical thing in the world, he said. And do you know why? Huang's argument is very simple. AI doesn't replace software. AI runs on software. The more AI agents you deploy, the more software infrastructure you need. More databases, more APIs, more middleware, et cetera. So every AI agent that replaces a paralegal still needs Westlaw's data. It still needs a CRM. It still needs document management. If anything, AI should increase the total amount of software the economy uses. Jensen's not wrong. He's also not making the argument he thinks he's making. Nobody serious is arguing that the world needs less software. The argument is that the world no longer needs to pay for software the way it currently pays for software. So Jensen is defending the product, and he's right to do so. The market is attacking the pricing model. Those are very different things. And confusing them is how incumbents lose transitions they should have survived. Print media made this same mistake. Newspapers had content people wanted. They had local information, investigative journalism, weather. The internet didn't make that content worthless. What the internet did was destroy the access model, the idea that you had to buy a whole newspaper to get the one section you cared about and that advertisers would pay premium rates to reach readers with no alternative. The content actually survived. The business model didn't. And that's why so many newspapers are in trouble. Print media's content did eventually get commoditized. Anybody can publish now. Software's content, like proprietary databases, like structured workflows, decades of accumulated enterprise data, that hasn't been commoditized, and it actually probably won't be. Thompson Reuters' case law database isn't something a startup vibe codes in a weekend. Salesforce's customer relationship data is irreplaceable for many of their clients. Adobe's creative tool ecosystem has a pretty deep moat. So the data is safe, but the per-seat access model for that data is not. And the companies whose entire financial identity is built around per-seat licensing, they're about to face the hardest strategic question in enterprise software. How do you reprice your most valuable assets without destroying your revenue in the transition? Bank of America's Vivek Arya published the most revealing analysis of the crash. He called the sell-off internally inconsistent. And he's right in a way that tells you something important about where the market's head is at right now on software and on AI. Investors were simultaneously running two theses. Thesis one, AI infrastructure spending is unsustainable and the CapEx boom will collapse. Thesis two, AI adoption will be so powerful that it renders established software business models obsolete. Both cannot be true. If AI is powerful enough to crash $285 billion in software market cap, the infrastructure required to run that AI is underbuilt, not overbuilt. The SaaS apocalypse is paradoxically the strongest possible demand signal for continued AI infrastructure investment. And yet, both trades were profitable in different hands at different moments. The deep-sea sell-off punished Nvidia last year. The SaaS correction punished Salesforce at almost the same time this year. Wall Street does not resolve logical contradictions. It rotates between them. One week, the market prices in an AI winter. The next, it prices in an AI revolution so total that legacy software can't survive it. The contradiction persists because no single firm needs to hold both positions. The market as a whole holds them, and the market as a whole has no obligation to be coherent. The incoherence is the real story, not the crash. The incoherence. But this is not really a story about stocks. It's bigger. While everyone was watching Thomson Reuters' stock price, a quieter story broke that almost no one paid attention to, and that tells you about where we're all headed more than any given stock chart. KPMG, one of the big four accounting firms, pressured Grant Thornton UK, which is its own auditor. Yes, the big four have to have auditors to cut their audit fees. The demand was to pass on cost savings from AI. Grant Thornton initially resisted, arguing that, quote, high-quality audits rely heavily on expert human judgment and that fees reflect the cost of people. KPMG's response, per the Financial Times, lower your prices or we'll find a new auditor. And Grant Thornton blinked. KPMG's international audit fees dropped from $416,000 in 2024 to just $357,000 in 2025. They got a 14% discount. And that story matters to me more than Thomson Reuters' stock price. And I want to tell you why. The SaaS apocalypse was just a market event. Traders were repricing stocks based on a changed view of the future. They do that all the time. The KPMG negotiation is an operating event, a real company using AI as a lever in a real business negotiation to extract a real price reduction from a real counterparty. The stock market repricing, that could reverse tomorrow. The KPMG precedent won't. Think about what KPMG actually did. They didn't automate their audit. They didn't replace Grant Thornton with AI. They used the existence of AI, the fact that everyone now knows these tasks can be done more cheaply, as a negotiating weapon. The threat isn't, we'll replace you with AI. The threat is, we both know AI changes the economics. So your old prices, they're not justified anymore. That's the playbook. And it works in every knowledge work fee negotiation now. If audit fees get renegotiated on the
