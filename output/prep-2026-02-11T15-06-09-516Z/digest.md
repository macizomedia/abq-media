# Main Talking Points

- A markdown file from some product manager at Anthropic erased $285 billion in market cap on the stock market in just 48 hours.
- The per-seat SaaS licensing model, the financial bedrock that the entire enterprise software economy has been built on for 20 years, it was already cracking.
- The software industry's average forward price-to-earnings ratio has been compressing for months, from 6x eight months ago to about 6x right when the sell-off hit.
- And we should be precise about what actually happened because the narrative has already crystallized into Anthropic crashed the software market.
- If a text file can approximate the core workflow of a $60 billion revenue legal information industry, then that whole pricing model that the industry is built on has a big structural problem.
- While everyone was watching Thomson Reuters' stock price, a quieter story broke that almost no one paid attention to, and that tells you about where we're all headed more than any given stock chart.
- The entire enterprise software economy, from Salesforce to ServiceNow to Adobe, runs on a model that says every human who touches this tool must pay a license fee.
- Software's content, like proprietary databases, like structured workflows, decades of accumulated enterprise data, that hasn't been commoditized, and it actually probably won't be.
