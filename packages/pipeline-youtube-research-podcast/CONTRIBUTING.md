# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Abquanta open-source modules.

## Workflow

1. Fork and create a branch: `feat/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>`
2. Use Conventional Commits
3. Add/update tests and docs
4. Open a PR with clear scope and rationale

## Standards

- Keep modules small and composable
- Separate core logic from adapters
- Document environment variables and side effects
